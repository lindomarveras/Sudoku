# Sudoku

Sudoku is one of the most famous puzzle game ever. With this Android app, you can play three different Sudoku levels:

* Easy
* Medium
* Hard 

This app generates a random Sudoku, that mean: countless time spent playing this game! However, you only have five attempts to solve
the board game.

The game incudes two keyboard modes:

* **PEN**. When you know the definitive number in a cell, select pen mode to print it.
* **PENCIL**. Use pencil mode to add notes in each cell. This mode will be useful to deduce the correct cell number.
